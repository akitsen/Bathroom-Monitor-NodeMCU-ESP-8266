## Bathroom Occupancy Monitor ##

Built out this project to monitor bathroom occupancy because I got tired of walking across the entire office to realize there's someone already in there.

It's a simple two file NodeMCU setup.

### Prerequisites ###
1. Get the [NodeMCU Flasher](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-flasher)
2. Flash your ESP8266.

### Instructions ###
1. Clone the repo
2. Edit 'init.lua' file and input the SSID & password for your wifi.
3. Set a static IP address
4. Upload the two files to your ESP8266 (I like to use [ESPlorer](https://esp8266.ru/esplorer/))
5. Poop to your hearts content.
