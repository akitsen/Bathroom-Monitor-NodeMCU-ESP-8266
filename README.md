## Bathroom Occupancy Monitor ##

Built out this project to monitor bathroom occupancy because I got tired of walking across the entire office to realize there's someone already in there.

It's a simple two file NodeMCU setup.

Step 1: Clone the repo
Step 2: Edit 'init.lua' file and input the SSID & password for your wifi.
Step 3: Set a static IP address
Step 4: Upload the two files to your ESP8266
Step 5: Poop to your hearts content.
